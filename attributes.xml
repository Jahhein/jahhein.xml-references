<!-- # href is the attribute -> www.tutorialspoint.com is the value of the attribute. -->

<!-- # An Atribute specifies a single property for the element, using a name/value pair.
# An XML-element can have one or more attributes. -->

<!-- ### Rules for Syntax of Attributes
# Attributes names in XML (unlike HTML) are case-sensitive. That is HREF and href are
# two different XML attributes.
#
# Same attribute cannot have two values in a syntax. The follow example shows
# incorrectly syntax because the attribute b is specified twice : -->
<a b="x" c="y" b="z">....</a>

<!--
 Attribute names are defined without quatation marks, whereas attribute values must
 always appear in quotation marks. Following example demonstrats incorrect xml syntax:
-->
<a b=x>...</a>

 <!-- In the above syntax, the attribute value is not defined in quotation marks. -->
