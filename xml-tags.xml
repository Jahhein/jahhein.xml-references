<!-- Let us learn about one of the most important part of XML,
the XML tags. XML tags form the foundation of XML. They define
the scope of an element in the XML. They can also be used to
insert comments, declare settings required for parsing the
environment and to insert special instructions. -->

<!-- basic  -->
<address> </address>


<!-- The text that appears between start-tag and end-tag is called content.
 An element which has no content is termed as empty.
 An empty element can be represented in two ways as below: -->
<hr></hr>


<!-- A complete empty-element tag is as shown below:  -->
<hr />


<!-- XML tags are case-sensitive. Following line of code is an example
of wrong syntax </Address>, because of the case difference in two tags,
which is treated as erroneous syntax in XML. -->
<address>This is wrong syntax</Address>


<!-- Following code shows a correct way, where we use the
same case to name the start and the end tag. -->
<address>This is correct syntax</address>


<!-- XML tags must be closed in an appropriate order, i.e., an
XML tag opened inside another element must be closed before
the outer element is closed. For example: -->
<outer_element>
   <internal_element>
      This tag is closed before the outer_element
   </internal_element>
</outer_element>
