<x>....</x>
<y>....</y>

<!-- # Wrong -->

<!--
 Root element: An XML document can have only one root element. For example,
 following is not a correct XML document, because both the x and y elements occur
 at the top level without a root element.
-->


<root>
   <x>...</x>
   <y>...</y>
</root>

 <!-- Correct -->
